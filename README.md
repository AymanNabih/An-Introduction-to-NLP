# An-Introduction-to-NLP
This jupyter notebook aims to introduce the reader to NLP fundamentals. We end up by two sentiment analysis examples: a trivial one and a more realistic case. For the latter, we use a set of 2000 documents. Half of these text display a negative overall tone while the remaining half are related to positive sentiments.
